How to run:
First install caffe-recurrent branch of caffe library from https://github.com/jeffdonahue/caffe/tree/recurrent

Then download the images from http://datasets.d2.mpi-inf.mpg.de/mateusz14visual-turing/nyu_depth_images.tar. Extract the images folder in main directory as well as in data/daquar/

Now extract the buffer_50-answer_last-all_answers.tar.gz in data/daquar as well as from examples/daquar folder.

To train the model, run:
	~/caffe/build/tools/caffe train --solver=lrcn_solver.prototxt
	(it will take sometime to train the model)

To test the model and predict output, run:
	python neural_qa.py
	(but correct the trained caffe model name in line 52)
Store the output of neural_qa.py in a file and get the question and answers from that file.


To calculate WUPS score, frist get the output from neural_qa.py script. Then run alignans.py from result folder script which aligns the predicted answers with correct ones. Then run calcute_wups.py script.
